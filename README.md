## Legal Notice.

C-LX RSS is based on parts of BlogoText 3 (under MIT Licence), by Timo van Neerden, itself based on BlogoText, by Fred Nassar.

Fred N. created BlogoText back in 2006. The script has been taken over by Timo V.N. in 2010 and until 2016.
BlogoText has then been taken over by Mickaël Schoentgen & Community.

C-LX RSS Reader has continued to evolve on it’s own.

C-LX RSS Reader is distributed under the MIT Licence.
